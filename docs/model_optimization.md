# Model Optimization Overview for Yelp Hybrid Recommendation System

This document summarizes the evolution and technical enhancements made to the Yelp Hybrid Recommender System from the initial baseline to the final competition version.

---

## ✨ Overview

The system leverages enhanced feature engineering and machine learning (XGBoost) to predict user ratings for businesses. It combines collaborative filtering, content-based features, and post-processing to achieve improved accuracy and robustness.

---

## 🏠 1. Overall Architecture

**Baseline:**
- Simple hybrid recommender (XGBoost + CF), fixed weight combination
- No prediction post-processing

**Final Version:**
- Modular architecture combining ML model, collaborative filtering, and post-processing
- Includes smoothing, extreme value limitation, and prediction range clipping

---

## 🔄 2. Data Processing & Feature Engineering

### ✏️ User Features
- **Baseline:** `average_stars`, `review_count`
- **Final:** Added `fans`, `useful`, `funny`, `cool`, `rating_deviation`, `activity_rate`

### 🏢 Business Features
- **Baseline:** `stars`, `review_count`
- **Final:** Added one-hot encoding for top 20 `categories`, `price_range`, `is_open`, and interaction terms (e.g., `stars * price_range`)

### 📅 Review Features
- **Baseline:** `useful`, `funny`
- **Final:** Added `text_length`, `cool`, aggregated stats for each user-business pair

### ✨ Feature Enhancements
- One-hot encoding for categories
- Log-transformations for skewed features
- K-Means clustering for users and businesses
- Feature interaction terms (e.g., diff between user’s avg star and business star)

---

## 🧬 3. Model Enhancements (XGBoost)

### ⚖️ Algorithm
- Still using XGBoost, but with better features and tuned hyperparameters

### ⚙️ Feature Scaling
- Applied `StandardScaler` for all numerical features

### ⚖️ Hyperparameter Optimization
- Changed learning rate: 0.1 → **0.03**
- Added regularization: `reg_alpha=0.15`, `reg_lambda=1.2`

---

## ✅ 4. Post-Processing

### 🧼 Smoothed Weighted Output
- Combined XGBoost output with user and business average ratings (15% each)

### ❌ Extreme Value Smoothing
- Values <2.0 and >4.0 were slightly smoothed to reduce RMSE impact

### 🌍 Range Clipping
- Ensured all predictions were within `[1, 5]`

## ⚡ 5. Final Evaluation

### 📊 Error Distribution
```
>=0 and <1:    103869
>=1 and <2:     32062
>=2 and <3:      5642
>=3 and <4:       471
>=4:               0
```

### 📈 Final Results
- **RMSE:** 0.9514
- **Execution Time:** 549.32 seconds
